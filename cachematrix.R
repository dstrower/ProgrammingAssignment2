## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special matrix that will have its
# inverse cached. If his matrix has its inverse given to it with the
# setInverse function, it  will remember this value.
# If the value of this matrix is changed
# with the set function, then it will remove the remembered value of the inverse.
# This matrix will also return a null value if it does not know the value of
# its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	m <- NULL
	set <- function(y) {
		 x <<- y
		 m <<- NULL
	}
	get <- function() x
	setInverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
	getInverse <- function() m
	list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function will return the inverse of the special matrix that is passed
# to it. This function will first ask the matrix for its inverse.
# If the value returned is not null, then is function returns this value as the inverse.
# If the value passed to it from the special matrix is null, then this 
# function will calculate the inverse and then store this answer inside
# the special matrix
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
